        "As someone looking to maximize my OJT experience while being efficient with my time and finances,  I've come up with a decision to gain practical experience in banks, cooperatives and water districts near my location, however I failed to secure spots. The rejections felt endless, but then, a door to a brighter future opened. I was offered and convinced to apply for an internship at Radztech Business Solutions which I’m already familiar with",
      Body: (
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Radztech is my last option honestly but
          never expected that this option would greatly impact me and my chosen
          career. My internship days at Radztech would definitely be my worth it
          decision as I not only found a company that will enhance my skills and
          gain learnings but also a family that I can count with. A company that
          allowed me to explore an ERP, provide instructions, impart their
          knowledge about Accounting Information Systems, and unleash your
          potential without overwhelming pressure. A family that will make you
          comfortable, allow you to express yourself freely, strengthen your
          morale, provide you home and make you feel cared and secured are just
          some of their ways to show their support to you. When I am assigned to
          a task, it’s as if I am portraying a role as friend, daughter, and
          mostly as an intern but never felt like I'm an outsider. Upon
          observation, the employees create an environment where hierarchical
          positions are not felt, yet respect and formality are always
          maintained. In the midst of work, moments can arise where everyone
          jokes, laughs, and sings together which are the times I will truly
          miss. <br /> <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a wonderful experience to be an
          intern in this company for 3 months where I not only refreshed and
          improved my accounting knowledge from school but also gained new
          concepts. They also demonstrate how technology can streamline the
          process of recording, summarizing, and reporting transactions which I
          was intensely captivated by. Throughout my time here, I've been
          continuously impressed by the robustness and sophistication of the
          accounting system employed by Radztech and at the same time the
          customization and automation that it offers. I am glad I chose
          Radztech because it has exposed me to facets of accounting and
          digitalization that I hadn't previously encountered, and I can
          confidently affirm that as we transition into the digital era,
          Radztech is at the forefront, fully embracing the digitalization wave.
          As I move forward on a different path for now, I carry with me the
          lessons and insights gained from this experience. All the knowledge
          imparted by Radztech to me will undoubtedly serve as a solid
          foundation as I step into the realm of business. I sincerely thank
          Radztech for giving me the chance to go beyond traditional education
          and helping me appreciate the power of efficient systems.

        "My internship at Radztech Business Solutions was an eye-opening experience. A little back story, i was a little afraid of joining the agency especially when we were told about their selection process. I was thinking of not going and just finding another agency.

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jumping on the start of my internship, we
          were oriented about the tasks that we were gonna do. The initial
          orientation left me overwhelmed. The tasks seemed endless and there's
          so much to do. Yet, with each completed task, my confidence grew. The
          initial overwhelm quickly transformed into a thirst for knowledge.
          Because this internship wasn't just me following instructions, it made
          me learn to adapt and at the same time made me grow professionally.
          But what truly set Radztech apart was their company culture. It wasn't
          just a workplace; it felt like a family. The company fostered a
          supportive environment that let me grow and pushed me outside my
          comfort zone in the best way possible.
          <br /> <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My internship at Radztech fully prepared me

        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I vividly remember I was taking my taxation
          exam when we were offered to join Radztech Business Solutions. We were
          six. My professor's offer gave me an instant relief from all the
          worries I have been thinking about internships. The only thing that
          was running in my mind while I was taking my exam was I'm going to
          take the opportunity. We were told how the brightest students of the
          class are only accepted and how we learn so much from them. Because I
          have failed academically so many times and this kind of recommendation
          comes once in a while, I decided to give it a go. I tried telling my
          friends. I encouraged them to give it a try. I convinced them this
          internship is something worthwhile even if I had no idea what would
          happen next. Their undecided faces and reluctant responses to me had
          me realize that what was a pressure for them is an opportunity to grow
          and improve professionally for me. I just knew that if it's easy,
          everyone would do it. We were six, I conquered alone. &nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp;It felt lonely until Patricia, Angelina, and Joan joined
          me. It felt really great to know that they were applying too.
          <br /> <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had my documents prepared for the
          application. But I never knew that it would test my patience as my
          fellow classmates had their documents signed and notarized while the
          four of us were waiting for Radztech.
          <br /> <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Radztech did not disappoint. People at
          Radztech welcomed us warmly. So much it felt like I was a member of
          their family. I just know there's something huge waiting for us that
          day and again, Radztech did not disappoint. The trust they gave to
          everyone of us was implicit. Their confidence in us really empowered
          us to do better than what we really measure our capabilities. There
          were no menial tasks like stapling, punching, and stamping papers.
          There were no fetching coffees and running errands for the employees.
          You can never feel clueless and a complete beginner here. You get to
          experience how they really do their work. Your internship here will
          never be a waste of your time and abilities. You are seen as someone
          who has to unlock your own potentials. And Radztech never failed to
          let us know that they want to be part of our professional growth.
          <br /> <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Radztech Business Solutions, you can
          never feel indifferent and unwanted. You'll get to personally know
          everyone in the office, you'll get to laugh endlessly, you'll
          definitely have to cry your heart openly.

      Body: (
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My internship experience was a series of
          setbacks, learning opportunities, and moments of redemption. At
          Radztech, I was able to gauge the gap between textbook learning and
          actual accounting practice, especially in today's digitalized world.
          This internship helped bridge that gap, sufficing my inadequate
          application of accounting theories and concepts, through generously
          providing us privileges to freely access first-hand their very own
          accounting information system known as UlapBiz. Moreover, I gradually
          adapted to the new learning environment and developed new
          relationships with my fellow interns and superiors. The first month
          was undeniably challenging as I interacted with people whose values
          and lifestyles differed from mine, causing me to reassess how
          extroverted I could be in this new setting. Initially, some of my
          relationships with them were rough and hesitant. However, as we spent
          more time together, trust and comfort began to build. One activity
          that helped us get to know each other better was the Bible study. It
          served as a bonding tool for us to have shared lives where
          vulnerability was embraced and honesty was heard--pointing us always
          of who God is, what He says He will do, and how He wants us to respond
          amidst the circumstances we were facing.Lastly, I rediscovered myself
          during those hundreds of hours. I learned to listen to my mind and
          body, recognizing a stranger within me—a version of myself I had never
          met or had ignored. I can now identify my ideal workplace, the type of
          work I am passionate about, the character traits and attitudes I need
